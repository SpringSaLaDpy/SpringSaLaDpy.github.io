# About SpringSaLaDpy

- SpringSaLaD is designed and implemented in the lab of 
[Leslie Loew](https://facultydirectory.uchc.edu/profile?profileId=Loew-Leslie) by Paul Michalski, 
with further enhancements by Bob ... and Joe Massison.
- The original Python code to process SpringSaLaD output files and compute cluster composition and 
average cluster occupancy were written by Aniruddha Chattaraj and used in 
several publivations([Chattaraj, Youngstrom & Loew, 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30661665/); 
[Chattaraj, Blinov & Loew, 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34236318/); 
[Chattaraj & Loew, 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36987392/)).
- Some features of this code were used in [MolClustPy](http://molclustpy.github.io) software 
that analyzed clusters simulated by [NFsim](https://michaelsneddon.net/nfsim/).
- The additional features were added by Harrison Perone under supervision of 
[Michael Blinov](https://health.uconn.edu/blinov-lab/).
